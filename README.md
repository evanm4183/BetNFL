## Overview

BetNFL is a sports betting website for moneyline bets on NFL games. It connects bettors with sportsbooks and allows them to place bets using the odds provided by the sportsbooks. DISCLAIMER: This app was built for educational purposes, so all of the money within the app is simulated and not real.

## Features

- Three unique user experiences:
  - Bettors can select a game and place bets based off the odds given by the sportsbooks
  - Sportsbook can set and adjust odds on games. These odds will be displayed to bettors for them to place bets.
  - Admins control site wide data (such as the scores of the games and the current week of games to display) and process bets once the games have been played
- Home page that displays all of the games for the current week in the NFL
- Automatic bet processing feature. An admin simply has to press a button and all the bets will be processed among all sportsbooks and bettors for a game.

## Tech Stack
